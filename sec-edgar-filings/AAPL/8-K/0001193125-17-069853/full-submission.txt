of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but
the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it
shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of
its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or
claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i)&nbsp;includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii)&nbsp;does not include a statement as to or an admission of

Section&nbsp;9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a)&nbsp;or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Lead Manager on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the
indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c)&nbsp;above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Lead Manager on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Lead Manager on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the
offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Lead Manager, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined
by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Lead Manager on
the other and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Lead Manager agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this subsection (d)&nbsp;were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d)&nbsp;shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the maximum amount the Lead Manager may be required to contribute shall be an amount equal to the total price at
which the Securities underwritten by the Lead Manager and distributed to the public were offered to the public less the amount of any damages which the Lead Manager has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
