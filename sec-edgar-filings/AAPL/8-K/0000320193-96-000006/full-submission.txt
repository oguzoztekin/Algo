Apple Chairman Gil Amelio Issues Statement On Second Quarter Outlook

    CUPERTINO, California--March 27, 1996--Following his first seven
weeks as chairman and chief executive officer of Apple Computer,
Inc., Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio issued a statement today discussing
his assessments of the Company's business situation and financial
outlook for the second fiscal quarter which ends March 29, 1996.
    "After my first couple of months on the job, I feel that it's time
for me to provide an update on Apple," said Dr. Amelio. "As has
been widely noted, the market for personal computers is unsettled.
    "We find ourselves facing three major challenges. First, we
anticipate that revenues and unit shipments will be substantially
below the levels of last year's second quarter. Secondly, the
slowdown in sales relative to our initial forecasts will
contribute to sizable charges related to inventory valuation
adjustments. Finally, as we've mentioned before, we will incur
significant restructuring charges in order to realign the company
for the future.
    "These factors will contribute to an anticipated second fiscal
quarter net after-tax loss of around $700 million, more than half
of which will be related to inventory write-downs and about a
quarter of which will be related to restructuring charges. The
inventory write-downs and restructuring charges are critical first
steps in orchestrating the comeback of the Company.
    "I'm confident at this point that I know what the problems are and
that they are fixable. The strategic and operating plans we are
currently developing will enable us to build upon Apple's
fundamental strengths and competitive position, reinforce our
customer appeal, and realize the company's long-term earnings
potential. We plan to aggressively address these issues and take
the necessary corrective actions. We will begin to articulate our
plans by early May.
    "I'd also like to add that I'm greatly encouraged by the
expressions of support I've received over the past two months from
thousands of Apple customers, business partners, developers, and
employees around the world who share our commitment to successfully meeting
our current challenges and achieving a great future."
    The statements herein concerning second quarter results are
preliminary   and   are  based  on  partial  information   and   management
assumptions.  Apple will be prepared to discuss details of its actual financial
results when it issues its second quarter earnings during the third week of
April.
