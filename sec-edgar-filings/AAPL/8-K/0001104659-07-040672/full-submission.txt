Board adopted amendments to this 2003 Employee Stock Plan, which shall govern
all grants of Awards made after this amendment and restatement, and which shall
become effective upon its approval by the Company&#146;s stockholders (the &#147;Effective
Date&#148;). </font><font style="letter-spacing:-.1pt;">For the terms and conditions of the Plan applicable to Awards granted
before the Effective Date, refer to the version of the Plan in effect as of the
date such Award was granted.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:18.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The purpose of the Plan
is to promote the long-term success of the Company and the creation of

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:18.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Plan seeks to achieve
this purpose by providing for discretionary long-term incentive Awards in the
form of Options (which may be Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock
Options), Stock Appreciation Rights, Stock Grants, Restricted Stock Units and
Cash Bonus Awards.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0pt 0pt 12.0pt;text-indent:18.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Plan shall be

intended favorable tax, legal or other treatment for the particular Award(s)&nbsp;(for
example, and without limitation, the Committee may provide that Fair Market
Value for purposes of one or more Awards will be based on an average of closing

the Committee may accelerate or provide in the applicable Award Agreement for
the accelerated vesting of any Stock Grant in connection with a change in

Stock Units have been satisfied or have lapsed, or, if the Committee so
provides in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, it may be deferred, in

right entitles the holder to be credited with an amount equal to all cash
dividends paid on one Share while the Restricted Stock Unit is outstanding. Dividend
equivalents may be converted into additional Restricted Stock Units and may be
made subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock
Units to which they attach. Settlement of dividend equivalents may be made in

If Options are forfeited or are terminated for any reason before vesting or
being exercised, then the shares underlying such Options shall again become

Non-Employee Director or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in
connection with any Option under the Plan shall not be available for subsequent
