Vacancies created by the removal of a director shall be filled only by the affirmative vote of shares holding a majority of the voting power represented and voting a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a least a majority of the voting power required to constitute a quorum), or by the unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon.  </LI></P>

If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at the same meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a class or series of shares is entitled to elect

<LI>A proxy which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified therein when it is held by any of the following or a nominee of any of the following: (i) a pledgee, (ii) a person who has purchased or agreed to purchase or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person who has sold a portion of such person's shares in the Corporation to the maker of the proxy, (iii)&nbsp;a creditor or creditors of the Corporation or the shareholder who extended or continued credit to the Corporation or the shareholder in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such extension or continuation of credit and the name of the person extending or continuing the credit, (iv) a person who has contracted to perform services as an employee of the Corporation, if a proxy is required by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such contract of employment, the name of the employee and the period of employment contracted 
for, (v) a person designated by or under a close corporation shareholder agreement or a voting trust agreement. In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the obligation secured by it. </LI></OL>
<P>Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares of the Corporation or dies, the debt of the Corporation or the shareholder is paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such shares or, in the case of uncertificated shares, on the initial transaction statement and written statements.

<P>&#9;(ii)&#9;For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting of shareholders by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation and any such proposed business must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action under the Code.

To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary (whether pursuant to this Section 5.14(a)(ii) or Section 5.14(b)) must set forth: </P>
<P>(A) as to each person, if any, whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (x) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act and (y) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected;</P>
<P>(B) if the notice relates to any business (other than the nomination of persons for election as directors) that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, (w) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, (x) the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), (y) the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and (z) any material interest in such business of such shareholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and</P>
<P>(C) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (w) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (x) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and by such beneficial owner, (y) any derivative positions with respect to shares of capital stock of the Corporation held or beneficially held by or on behalf of such shareholder and by or on behalf of such beneficial owner, the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into with respect to the shares of capital stock of the Corporation by or on behalf of such shareholder and by or on behalf of such beneficial owner, and the extent to which any other agreement, arrangement or understanding has been made, the effect or intent of which is to increas
e or decrease the voting power of such shareholder and such beneficial owner with respect to shares of capital stock of the Corporation,  (z) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (aa) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (bb) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee or (cc) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination.</P>
<P>The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine (x) the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation, and (y) whether such nominee qualifies as an &quot;independent director&quot; or &quot;audit committee financial expert&quot; under applicable law, securities exchange rule or regulation, or any publicly-disclosed corporate governance guideline or committee charter of the Corporation.  </P>
<P>&#9;(iii)&#9;Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 5.14 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by this Section 5.14 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.</P>

 of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice in the same form as required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 5.14 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.  In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commen

<P>(c)&#9;General.  </P>
<P>(i)&#9;Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.14 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.14.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.14 and (B) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 5.14, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.14, unless otherwise required b

For purposes of this Section 5.14, to be considered a qualified representative of the shareholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such shareholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such shareholder to act for such shareholder as proxy at the meeting of shareholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of shareholders.</P>
<P>(ii)&#9;For purposes of this Section 5.14, &quot;public announcement&quot; shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press, or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.</P>
<P>(iii)&#9;Nothing in this Section 5.14 shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals or nominations in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereto) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to nominate and elect directors pursuant to and to the extent provided in any applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation.</P>
