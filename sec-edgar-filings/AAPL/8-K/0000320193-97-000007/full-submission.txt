Apple Computer Details Restructuring Plans

Company Paves Return Road to Leadership With 
Focus on Its Distinctive Product Strengths

CUPERTINO, Calif. March 14, 1997 Apple 
Computer, Inc. Chairman and CEO Gilbert F. Amelio 
today detailed a restructuring plan that sharpens 
the Company's focus on strengths that have been at 
the heart of its success exceptionally easy-to-use 
personal and mobile computers with unique 
multimedia and Internet capabilities.
	
The top priorities guiding our reorganization are 
the rapid delivery of distinctive products for our 
loyal business, education, and home customers, and 
the development of a robust next-generation 
operating system to carry them into the future,  
Amelio said.  We can best achieve these goals by 
streamlining our organization, simplifying our 
product lines to deliver fewer but much stronger 
models, and stopping investments in activities that 
are not central to these core businesses. 
	
Apple began the reorganization last month with a 
new streamlined organization that focuses research 
and development efforts on products that are 
central to its key businesses, unifies Apple's 
multiple marketing groups, aligns the Company's 
sales teams to its market strengths, and fully 
integrates Apple's and NeXT's resources. This 
simpler organization has two charters: first, to bring 
distinctive products to market quickly and to 
market them aggressively to customers in Apple's 
key markets, and second, to deliver the Company's 
next-generation operating system, code-named 
Rhapsody, while continuing to enhance the Mac(R) 
OS.

<PAGE>                  5	
The Company simultaneously accelerated moves to 
simplify its product line and deliver fewer, but 
more competitive models, such as the recently 
announced high-end Power Macintosh(R) and 
Power Book(R) 3400 computers and the new entry-
level products, scheduled to be announced in April. 
	
The Company has also re-evaluated the funding of 
certain activities and technologies that are not 
central to Apple's core business strategy, or that 
can be better achieved through industry standards, 
or that represent a strong business opportunity for 
developers. 
		
The resulting restructuring includes the lay-off of 
approximately 2,700 Apple employees with 
notifications scheduled to begin later this month, 
and an estimated $155 million increase to the 
Company's restructuring reserves to be charged to 
the Company's second fiscal quarter earnings. The 
majority of the total restructuring cost is 
attributable to the workforce reduction, and the 
remainder to the cancellation of contracts and 
leases and to asset writeoffs.

While re-evaluating the funding of certain activities 
and technologies, the Company reiterated its 
commitment to deliver Rhapsody in 1998, and to 
continue to enhance the Mac OS. Technologies that 
will be maintained as part of the Mac OS but will 
receive reduced investments for future upgrades 
include Open Doc(R) component software technology, 
Cyberdog(R), Open Transport(R), Game Sprockets, and 
Mac OS Development Tools. Some other technologies 
that are not part of the Mac OS, such as the speech 
technologies, will be maintained without further 
major upgrades planned.

Other activities and technologies that Apple will not 
continue to fund include the Video Conferencing 
Solution and AIX Server Software. Apple is also 
exploring a wide range of options for still other 
technologies and activities, including discussions 
with prospective licensees and business partners.
<PAGE>                  6
	
As part of its renewed focus, the Company also said 
that it is altering the delivery schedule for Mac OS 
releases beyond Mac OS 8, scheduled for 
introduction in July 1997. Instead of two full retail 
releases of Mac OS in 1998, as previously 
announced, Apple plans to ship one complete 
release in mid-1998 (Allegro), and a full release 
yearly from then on. Between the full releases, the 
latest system improvements will be made readily 
available through updates; Apple plans to ship two 
system updates between Mac OS 8 and Allegro. The 
change makes more resources available for work on 
the next-generation operating system and directly 
answers customers' cost and logistics concerns for 
frequent major releases.

 With this restructuring, and the painful decisions 
that have come with it, we are addressing the 
problem of resource fragmentation and the 
resulting weakness,  Amelio continued.  We will 
limit our focus and put significant muscle behind 
targeted efforts in order to successfully develop 
and market winning solutions that have made 
Macintosh customers some of the most passionate 
and loyal in the industry. We fully intend to keep 
that spirit alive.

Apple Discusses Q2 Revenue Outlook

CUPERTINO, Calif. March 14, 1997 In a conference 
call with financial analysts today, Apple Computer, 
Inc. executive vice president and chief financial 
officer Fred Anderson indicated that the Company 
expects revenues for its second fiscal quarter 
ending March 28, 1997 to be between $1.6 and $1.7 
billion dollars.

 As we've previously discussed,  said Anderson  we 
exited the first quarter with surplus channel 
inventory. We've been extremely pleased with the 
results of channel sell through of that inventory 
this quarter, particularly in the Americas. However, 
this surplus channel sell-off has been off-set by 
reduced sell-in during the quarter to restore a more 
normalized channel inventory level. This 
phenomenon coupled with the traditional seasonal 
softness of demand in our second quarter suggests 
that we will generate lower revenues than those we 
achieved in our first fiscal quarter,  Anderson 
stated.

Apple expects to release the results of its second 
fiscal quarter in mid-April.
