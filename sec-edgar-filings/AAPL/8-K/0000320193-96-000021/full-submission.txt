Item 4.	Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

	On December 4, 1996, the Audit and Finance Committee of the 
Registrant's Board of Directors recommended, and the Registrant's Board of 
Directors approved, the engagement of the independent certified public 
accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP to audit the consolidated financial 
statements of the Registrant for the year ending September 26, 1997. 
Accordingly, the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP as the Registrant's 
independent auditors will be discontinued effective upon conclusion of the 
audit of the Registrant's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
September 27, 1996. 

	The reports of Ernst & Young LLP on the Registrant's consolidated 
financial statements for each of the two fiscal years in the period ended 
September 29, 1995 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of 
opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or 
accounting principles and the report of Ernst & Young LLP on the Registrant's 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 27, 1996 is not 
expected to contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion or to be 
qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 

	In connection with the audits of the Registrant's consolidated 
financial statements for each of the two fiscal years ended September 27, 1996 
and September 29, 1995 and the subsequent interim period prior to December 4, 
1996, there were no disagreements between the Registrant and Ernst & Young LLP
on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement 
disclosure, or auditing scope and procedures which, if not resolved to the 
satisfaction of Ernst & Young LLP, would have caused Ernst & Young LLP to make 
reference to the matter in their reports.

	There were no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 
304(a)(l)(v)) during the two fiscal years ended September 27, 1996 and 
September 29, 1995 and the subsequent interim period prior to December 4, 1996.

	The Registrant has not consulted with KPMG Peat Marwick LLP during the
last two years or subsequent interim period prior to December 4, 1996 on either 
the application of accounting principles or the type of opinion KPMG Peat 
Marwick LLP might issue on the Registrant's financial statements.

	The Registrant requested Ernst & Young LLP to furnish it with a letter 
addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not 
Ernst & Young LLP agrees with the above statements, which letter is attached as
Exhibit 16.1.
