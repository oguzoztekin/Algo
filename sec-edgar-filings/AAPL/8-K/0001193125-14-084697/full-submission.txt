Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (the &#147;<B>Severance Date</B>&#148;), regardless of the reason for the termination of the Participant&#146;s employment with the Company or a
Subsidiary, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily. In the event the Participant&#146;s Severance Date is the result of a termination of the Participant&#146;s employment due to the Participant&#146;s death or Disability, and
the Severance Date occurs prior to the Vesting Date, on the Vesting Date the Award shall vest with respect to a number of Stock Units determined by multiplying (i)&nbsp;the Stock Units subject to the Award that would have otherwise vested pursuant
to the Award on such Vesting Date but for the termination of employment and to the extent the applicable performance-based vesting requirement is satisfied, by (ii)&nbsp;the Severance Fraction (determined as set forth below). Any Stock Units that
are unvested on the Severance Date and that are not eligible to vest on the Vesting Date following the Severance Date pursuant to the preceding sentence shall terminate as of the Severance Date, and any Stock Units that remain outstanding and
unvested after giving effect to the preceding sentence shall terminate as of the Vesting Date. The &#147;<B>Severance Fraction</B>&#148; means a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of whole calendar months that have elapsed between
the Award Date and the Severance Date, and the denominator of which shall be&nbsp;the number of whole calendar months&nbsp;between the Award Date and the Vesting Date. If any unvested Stock Units are terminated pursuant to this Award Agreement, such
Stock Units (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent the applicable performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied, the Vesting
Date, as provided in <U>Exhibit A</U>) without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant&#146;s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be. </FONT></P>
